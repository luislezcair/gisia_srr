It all boils down to freshness, quality and flavor.\n\nBrewing tea in its loose leaf form allows the hot water to infuse every inch of a high-quality, whole leaf tea, producing the freshest, fullest flavor possible.\n\nThe commercial tea bag is a modern invention designed to make tea drinking easy and convenient, but in its history gave us a lower-quality tea product that produces a one-dimensional flavor profile.\n\nHere are the biggest differences between artisan loose leaf tea and commercial tea bag tea:\n\n<strong>Artisan Loose Leaf Tea</strong> <strong>Commercial Tea Bag Tea</strong>\n*Produced in the artisan orthodox method *Produced in the machine-driven non-orthodox or Crush-Tear-Curl (CTC) method\nWhole leaf, high-quality grade tea Cut leaf, low-grade tea dust and fannings\nSubtle nuances and flavor extracted from whole tea leaves that are allowed to expand fully in hot water One-dimensional flavor profile meant for a strong brew that can stand up to milk and sugar\nPackaged loose in airtight containers to seal in freshness and flavor Often bagged in bleached paper material that can add chemicals and off flavors to your brewed cup\nProduced seasonally in small quantities in an artisan method that involves hand-picking and hand-sorting quality tea leaves Machine-produced in high volume to be warehoused and stored for long periods of time\nThe same leaves can be steeped multiple times for several cups of tea Flavor is fully extracted after just one steeping\n\n*For detailed information about orthodox vs. non-orthodox tea production, visit our \u201cHow is Tea Made?\u201d page.\n\n<h2>History of the tea bag</h2>\n\nMost modern day commercial tea bags that contain CTC tea are made of bleached paper fiber and contain heat-sealable plastic. But the very first tea bag was made of hand-sewn silk and contained whole leaf tea.\n\nDiscovered by accident\n\nDuring the first decade of the 1900s, New York tea merchant Thomas Sullivan began shipping small samples of his whole leaf teas packaged in hand-sewn silk tea bags to customers around the world.\n\nSending samples in silk tea bags was an inexpensive way for Mr. Sullivan to get his newest teas into customers\u2019 cups without having to pony up the cost of packaging and shipping in tea tins.\n\nThe whole leaf tea was supposed to be removed from the silk bag to be brewed, but customers found it easier to just brew the tea contained in the bag. So when customers re-ordered tea from Mr. Sullivan, they requested he send it to them packaged in tea bags.\n\nEvolved over time\n\nHand-sewn silk tea bags proved costly and time-consuming to produce, so Mr. Sullivan moved to a gauze material and produced tea bags commercially for his customers during the 1920s.\n\nSince Mr. Sullivan never patented his tea bag discovery, other merchants began to introduce their own versions of the tea bag to market\u2014very smartly patenting their own inventions\u2014and various versions of the tea bag evolved over time.\n\n* German tea company Teekanne reportedly created their own version of the tea bag for World War I soldiers. Dubbed \u201ctea bombs\u201d, the bags were made of fine cotton and were included in all German soldiers\u2019 provisions.\n* William Hermanson, founder of a Boston paper company, patented the first heat-sealable paper fiber tea bag in 1930.\n* Tetley Tea, inspired by the American tea bag invention, is credited with inventing the first square tea bag in England in 1944. They developed a tea bag machine that could stitch 40 tea bags per minute for export.\n* The Lipton Tea Company, founded in Scotland in 1880, patented the four-sided, flow-through paper tea bag in 1952. The double chamber bag allowed the tea greater contact with water and more room for the tea leaves to expand in the bag.\n* Tetley Tea was the first to introduce the round paper tea bag in 1992. This was mainly a marketing invention designed for tea drinkers who preferred drinking tea from a big mug rather than a dainty cup. They also reduced some packaging waste, since round tea bags were typically free of the string and paper tags attached to square tea bags.\n* Brooke Bond, the parent company of the United Kingdom\u2019s PG Tips, is credited with inventing the pyramid tea bag in 1997. The tall pyramid shape, they claimed, would perform like a teapot, giving tea leaves 50 percent more room in the bag than flat tea bag varieties.\n\nDominated by machine\n\nAs the popularity of and demand for tea bags grew, tea merchants and producers looked for ways to cut costs and increase production.\n\nSince customers proved to care more about the convenience of the tea bag than the quality of the tea, commercial tea producers moved to the machine-driven CTC method of tea production to keep up with tea bag demand.\n\nTea producers typically sourced lower quality tea and shredded the leaves to fit into small tea bags that could be machine produced, sealed with plastic or glue, and packaged with tags and strings for a more grocery-store marketable packaging design than loose leaf tea.\n\n<h2>Improving the tea bag experience</h2>\n\nAt Teatulia, we\u2019re able to give customers the best of both worlds \u2013 loose leaf quality and tea bag convenience. Just like New York tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in the early 1900s.\n\nHow? Tea bag technology is improving and we\u2019ve discovered eco-friendly ways to offer tea bags to our customers, without sacrificing freshness and flavor.\n\nBoth of Teatulia\u2019s tea bag options are made of unbleached, compostable materials that are chemical-free. There are no tags, strings, staples or extra packaging for our tea bags, so we\u2019re able to deliver convenience with less waste. And both of our tea bags contain only fresh, flavorful, artisan-produced tea leaves.\n\nOur pyramid tea bag: We offer our organic, whole leaf teas packaged in single-serving corn silk pyramid tea bags. Our pyramid tea bags are large and roomy to give the fresh tea leaves plenty of space to interact with hot water for full flavor extraction. They can even be steeped multiple times, so you can get several cups of tea out of one tea bag.\n\nOur round tea bag: For customers who\u2019ve asked for the ultimate in convenience plus the strong flavor of a full-bodied tea, we\u2019re now offering tea in round, unbleached paper bags. Unlike commercial tea bags filled with low-grade, shredded tea leaves and tea dust, our round tea bags are filled with fresh, organic, fine-cut tea leaves. The resulting brew is fuller-bodied and stronger than our pyramid tea bag brew.\n\nLearn about how tea is processed.\n\nLearn what it means to be certified organic.\n\nLearn more about Teatulia\u2019s single garden direct organic tea.\n\n<strong> Sources:</strong>\nHistory of the Tea Bag by United Kingdom Tea Council\nTea Bag by Wikipedia\nThe History of the Tea Bag by Teekanne\nA (Tea) Potted History by Tetley\nHistory of Lipton Tea by History of Business\nBrooke Bond's 'Gotta Brand New Bag' by The Free Library\nThe Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide by Mary Lou Heiss and Robert J.
