The coffee brand acquired the brand in 2012 and says it has made over $1bn in sales since launching in the US.\n\nWhile the iced teas are rolled out this summer, the hot teas and lattes will be introduced into UK stores in autumn. Its campaign for the iced teas launched last month, will run throughout the whole of August and be supported by in-store, digital, social and above-the-line activity.\n\nThe US brand\u2019s decision to enter the UK tea market is an interesting one, as latest figures show it seems to be struggling. Value sales have fallen by 6% from \u00a3699m in 2010 to an estimated \u00a3654m in 2015 across the tea retail market in the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, in volume terms over the same time period, sales have dropped by 22%, from 97 million kg to an estimated 76 million kg. Mintel forecasts that volume sales will drop to 68.7 million kg by 2020.\n\nSpeaking on the declining market, Emma Clifford, senior food and drink analyst at Mintel, says: \u201cStandard black tea is struggling to maintain consumers\u2019 interest amid growing competition from other drinks \u2013 held back by a rather uninspiring image. This has translated into the downfall of the tea category overall.\u201d\n\n<h2>Stealing coffee\u2019s thunder</h2>\n\nThere are some pockets of growth within the UK tea market, however. While black tea sales are falling, green tea and \u2018flavoured\u2019 teas are seeing sales growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen fruit and herbal bags and other speciality tea sales all grow. Green tea has seen the strongest growth, which is partly due to health reasons as people consider it a healthier option,\u201d explains Richard Caines, senior food and drink analyst at Mintel.\n\n\u201cAlso, there\u2019s a lot more innovation that we\u2019re seeing. There are more different types of flavours, which the younger generations seem to be interested in.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what Starbucks hopes to capitalise on. Its hot teas have herbal, green and chai variants, but the brand also offers more premium and fruity \u2018tea blends\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe see it as the next space we can play in. We want to modernise and rejuvenate [the category] while boosting the overall tea market.\u201d\n\nJamie McQuary, digital marketing manager, Starbucks\n\n\u201cThere are so many ways you can drink tea. In the US we are trialling a sparkling iced tea, so we like to try everything out. There are many flavours and we\u2019re only just scratching the surface when it comes to tea,\u201d Starbucks digital marketing manager Jamie McQuary told Marketing Week.\n\nNick Liddell, director of consulting at branding agency The Clearing, agrees there is a potential for the brand to create a buzz and steal coffee\u2019s thunder by reintroducing tea in a \u201cspecialist and novel\u201d way.\n\n\u201cIn recent years there has been a lot more talkability around coffee. But we\u2019re reaching a point where coffee has become so familiar and part of every day life, that reintroducing tea in a specialist way can give it that novelty that coffee once had,\u201d he says.\n\nAs part of its Teavana campaign, Starbucks organised various experiential events including a \u2018sunrise yoga\u2019 session.\n<h2>Battling sugar concerns</h2>\n\nHowever, Starbucks\u2019s decision to launch an iced tea range while UK consumers are increasingly moving away from sugary drinks is a questionable one. The announcement of a UK tax on soft drinks, which will come into force in 2018, as well as the Government health committee\u2019s damning childhood obesity report have put renewed pressure on soft drinks brands.\n\nEarlier this year, Starbucks also got wrapped up in a scandal around the sugar content in its hot drinks. Campaign group Action on Sugar said its venti \u2018grape with chai, orange and cinnamon hot mulled fruit\u2019 drink contained a total of 25 teaspoons of sugar per serving.\n\nWhile the brand\u2019s creative focus for its iced teas is based around \u201cthe wellbeing of the mind, body and soul\u201d, McQuary says the iced tea range \u201cisn\u2019t necessarily a wellness product\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is a product that you can have sweetened or unsweetened. There are many ways it can be customised so there is less sugar. It\u2019s not necessarily a wellness product, it helps your total wellbeing, it\u2019s aimed to be uplifting and refreshing,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe Clearing\u2019s Liddell believes Starbucks is running a risk by focusing its iced teas around wellness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny way to get into the tea market. Tea has a natural origin and there are lots of implied health benefits if you have a tea-based drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you add lots of sugar to a product, you diminish its natural associations and benefits. It\u2019s a real stretch to present it as a \u2018healthy\u2019 product.\u201d\n\nNick Liddell, director of consulting, The Clearing\n\nWhen it comes to its hot tea innovations, however, Starbucks may be onto something. It could potentially profit from similar conditions that drove the resurgence of gin\u2019s popularity.\n\n\u201cTea and gin have a lot of the same hallmarks. Everyone has their own idea of how a gin and tonic should be made, which is the same with tea. Gin has started to become infused with interesting botanical ingredients, and tea is exactly the same in that regard. But iced tea seems to be a bit of a distraction,\u201d says Liddell.\n\nThe Marketing Week <strong>Newsletter</strong>\n\nSign up\n\n<h2>Similar stories you might like</h2>\n\nNewsFood & DrinkStarbucks\n\n<h1>Starbucks aims to halve serving time as it launches first UK \u2018express\u2019 store</h1>\n\n22 Jul 201625 Jul 2016\n\nShare\n\nNewsFood & DrinkAdvertisingStarbucks\n\n<h1>Starbucks puts \u2018youthful and modern twist\u2019 on tea as it launches Teavana range in the UK</h1>\n\n8 Apr 201611 Apr 2016\n\nShare\n\nAnalysisAmazon Facebook StarbucksBrandZ 2016\n\n<h1>Facebook, Starbucks and Amazon are the fastest risers in this year\u2019s BrandZ ranking</h1>\n\n8 Jun 20168 Jun 2016\n\nShare\n\nWhat\u2019s popular on Marketing Week\n\nOpinionCareersMark Ritson - Marketing Strategy\n\n<h1>Mark Ritson: Maybe it\u2019s just me, but shouldn\u2019t an \u2018expert\u2019 in marketing be trained in marketing?</h1>\n\n12 Jul 201618 Jul 2016\n\nShare\n\nOpinionAgenciesAdvertisingMark Ritson - Brand Leadership\n\n<h1>Mark Ritson: Saatchi & Saatchi\u2019s Kevin Roberts is blind to the ongoing male dominance of advertising</h1>\n\n1 Aug 20163 Aug 2016\n\nShare\n\nAnalysisB2B Consumer Goods FMCG Technology & TelecomsCareers\n\n<h1>The big debate: Do marketing experts need a qualification in marketing?</h1>\n\n2 Aug 20164 Aug 2016\n\nShare\n\nJob of the Week\n\nLatest Jobs\n\n*\nAccount Manager\n\nDirect Recruitment\n\n*\nHead of Digital Operations for Europe\n\nClarks\n\n*\nMarketing Manager\n\nHealth Management\n\n*\nDigital Marketing Manager\n\nReleasd\n\n*\nHeads of Brands and Marketing\n\nParkwood Leisure\n\n*\nHead of Marketing, Communications & Income Generation\n\nAllergy UK\n\nTop Jobs\n\n* Twitter\n* Linkedin\n* Facebook\n* RSS\n\n* Contact\n* T&Cs\n* Privacy\n* Advertising Information\n\n\u00a9 2016.
