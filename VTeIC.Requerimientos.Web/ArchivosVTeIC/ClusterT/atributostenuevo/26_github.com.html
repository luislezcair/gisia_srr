Today, JPL is instrumental in some of the most important research of our time, including climate change, energy, robotics, and astrophysics, and software development makes that research possible.\n\nInter-agency and international collaboration has been integral to JPL\u2019s success for decades, but software development was fractured internally. Legacy application lifecycle management tools were employed with varying measures of success. But having no simple way to allow other developers to see how others were working, they were duplicating work.\n\nJPL began to question their software development tools. \u201cWhere can I share this code I\u2019ve written?\u201d At that point, the answer was, \u201cNowhere, we don\u2019t do that at JPL.\u201d At the same time, applicants to JPL began replacing links to static code archives with URLs to popular sites for sharing and collaborating on source code on their resumes. Development outside JPL was becoming more collaborative, and it was hoped that a collaboration hub for software development would raise awareness between scientists for each others\u2019 projects and workflow within JPL.\n\nJPL made an initial installation of GitHub Enterprise available within the Operations Laboratory, a center for innovation in mission operations technology, and it was quickly adopted by the twenty or so regular users of the lab. By August of 2013, usage had spread to 80 users through word-of-mouth. Availability of GitHub Enterprise was officially announced in October, and by December 2014, the installation had grown to more than 600 users.\n\nSimple administration tools are a big asset when it comes to convincing groups at JPL to get started on GitHub Enterprise. There\u2019s nothing on the backend of their installation that might cause a fracturing of the community, so GitHub Enterprise becomes a reflection of the individuals and teams that use it.\n\nBy providing a platform that integrates with lots of different tools and supports many different workflows, we\u2019ve provided the greatest common denominator to our developers, while capturing the greatest value for JPL\u2014a single location where developers can find code that solves JPL\u2019s problems.\n\nSoftware collaboration has picked up traction at JPL. There are now monthly meetups across labs to share openly, and organizers often underestimate the number of chairs required for the events. They\u2019re starting to see conversations around modernizing the software practice, and in having a more vital role in the open source community. They\u2019re building a collaborative and contributory community.\n\n<h2>How JPL is integrating with GitHub</h2>\n\nJPL has a tool service that supports some popular software tools, including AccuRev, Bamboo, Coverity, Eclipse, IDL, JIRA and JIRA Agile, JRebel, QMetry, Subversion, STK and others. They use the GitHub API to get information on who is using the system, where to focus evangelism, and who to talk to about specific development projects.\n\nHow NASA\u2019s JPL is integrating with GitHub\n\nJPL uses a tool service that supports popular products like AccuRev, Bamboo, Coverity, Eclipse, IDL, JIRA and JIRA Agile, JRebel, QMetry, Subversion, STK and others.\n\nThey use the GitHub API to get information on who is using the system, where to focus evangelism, and who to talk to about specific development projects.\n\n<h2>More stories from our customers</h2>\n\nDominion Enterprises\n\nFind out how over 600 developers at Dominion Enterprises use GitHub to make their work more transparent.\n\nMailChimp\n\nSee how a switch to GitHub Enterprise helped MailChimp reduce developer onboarding from three months to three days.\n\nCoverMyMeds\n\nLearn how CoverMyMeds uses GitHub Enterprise to balance transparency and security in a highly regulated industry.\n\n<h2>What will your story be?</h2>\n\n<h2>Organization</h2>\n\n$9ARS $133.50 per user / month</strong>\n\nWork with your team on GitHub.com in unlimited private repositories.
