The challenge now is to capture the attention of those hearty souls that brave the cold and are hurrying by our front door, bundled head to toe against the freezing winds and snow. This is tea drinking season, but it is NOT the season in which new consumers stroll down the avenue looking for new retailers to visit. more >\n\ncomments\n\n<h1>Branding in the tea business</h1>\n\nConsumer uncertainty is the enemy that is slowing the growth of the Specialty Tea Industry. Consumers are hesitant to pay a premium for a luxury or gourmet product when they are uncertain of its value. As a result, the vast majority of tea drinkers in the US retreat into the predictable mediocrity of mass-market tea bags on grocery store shelves. There has to be a better way. more >\n\ncomments\n\n<h1>The Fountain of Customer Loyalty</h1>\n\nWhy is it that the keys to building customer loyalty are so obvious and yet so few companies do it well? I've read a thousand articles and books on the importance of branding, value, quality, personal service, etc. Any consumer can tell you what they want from a retailer, and most of them will also tell you that the majority of companies do a pretty poor job converting customers into passionate fans. I'm not going to repeat all of the obvious keys to running a good business, but I do want to share what I believe is the Fountain of Customer Loyalty in the tea business: identity. more >\n\ncomments\n\n<h1>Blend your own teas</h1>\n\nGiving customers the opportunity to create their own custom blends goes a long way towards accomplishing each of Adagio\u2019s primary retail strategies; making tea accessible to the average consumer, and creating a sensory-rich and entertaining shopping experience.

At the end of the day, the consumer will (and should) drive the evolution of any controls that protect the quality, environmental sustainability and economic sustainability of the foods they consume. That said, it is important for those of us in the tea industry, and those of us who care about the tea industry, to understand and communicate the pros and cons of any particular certification or quality control approach. more >\n\ncomments\n\n<h1>Selling Fair Trade: Pros and cons</h1>\n\nIn recent years we've seen an explosion of claims and certifications in the tea industry. It is important for those in the industry, and those who care about the industry, to understand and communicate the pros and cons of any particular certification or quality control approach. A few days ago I shared my thoughts on the pros and cons of marketing Organic teas. Today I'm turning my attention to Fair Trade. more >\n\ncomments\n\n<h1>Can free tea increase sales?</h1>\n\nAn internal debate has been underway for the past month or so on the proper role of Tea-to-Go in the Adagio retail concept.
