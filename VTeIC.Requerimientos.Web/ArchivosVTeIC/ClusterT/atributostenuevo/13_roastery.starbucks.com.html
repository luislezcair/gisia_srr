Less than 1% of all Starbucks beans will qualify for this distinction, and some are so scarce they might never be available again. Enjoy them while they last.\n\n<h2>Discover</h2>\n\nStarbucks Reserve\u00ae Coffee\n\nA Relentless Pursuit of Some of the Rarest Coffees\n\nEach year we travel the world in search of great coffee. Every once in a while, we discover a handful of beans so special and rare that we can\u2019t wait to bring them home and share. Our buyers and agronomists at our Farmer Support Centers work closely with farmers around the world, giving us the ability to discover and source unusual, one-of-a-kind coffees. Our team of expert Starbucks tasters evaluates more than 250,000 cups every year in our tasting room, selecting just a few of the most unique coffees to become Starbucks Reserve\u00ae coffees.\n\nTailored roast profiles for each coffee\n\nCollaborating with our tasting team, our master roasters experiment until they unlock each coffee's inherent flavor qualities. We don\u2019t tell the bean how to taste \u2013 we listen to know what the bean has to offer so we can bring out the best flavor.\n\nOur Rarest Coffees, Small-Batch Roasted in Seattle\n\nOur Starbucks Reserve\u00ae coffees are available in limited supply here at the Roastery, in select Starbucks\u00ae stores or delivered to you.\n\nExplore Starbucks Reserve\u00ae\n\n*\n\n*\n\nBean Storage area\n\nThe Green Harvest of Starbucks Reserve\u00ae Coffee\n\nWe know these beans come from farmers\u2019 hands to our hands. These farmers are entrusting their harvest to us. When the burlap bags full of green coffee arrive, we open them and check for quality. This is where the Roastery process begins.\n\n*\n\nSTORAGE SILOS\n\nPUTTING OUR MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE ON DISPLAY\n\nThe beans are then transferred via specially designed tubes into one of six 1,000 pound-capacity silos for aeration and to rest before roasting. All of this is open for you to see. The Roastery contains other sets of silos too, including five above the Main Bar where you can see what\u2019s being served today.\n\n*\n\nSMALL-BATCH and MICRO ROASTERS\n\nSMALL-BATCH ROASTING TOOLS\n\nOur master roasters\u2019 craft is displayed with ever-escalating focus and precision. Master roaster Brad Anderson explains, \u201cIt\u2019s like conducting a symphony.\u201d Capable of roasting up to 260 lbs of beans at a time, the larger of our two customized Probat\u2122 roasters, the G120, is what we use for roasting Starbucks Reserve\u00ae coffees shipped worldwide and served outside of the Roastery. The coffee roasted in the smaller P25 is available only to customers at the Roastery \u2014 each bean for every coffee drink we serve.\n\n*\n\nA GENTLE TRANSFER SYSTEM\n\nSPECIALLY DESIGNED TO CARE FOR UNIQUE AND DELICATE BEANS\n\nWe use air in vacuum-powered tubes to gently convey beans around the Roastery, ensuring that the beans reach their destination in peak condition.\n\n*\n\nCOPPER COOLING CASK\n\nTHE SECRET TO ACHIEVING OPTIMAL FLAVOR\n\nWe know that the flavor in just-roasted coffee continues to develop after roasting. Our recommendation is that coffee should rest and de-gas for at least eight days. Only then does it reach peak flavor and is ready for serving in our handcrafted beverages. This hand-hammered, custom-built cask is where all beans go to rest before brewing.\n\nUNIQUE ITEMS\n\nAVAILABLE AT THE ROASTERY AND ONLINE\n\nSHOP GEAR\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nDiscover the art, science and craft of truly inspired coffee at\n\nThe Starbucks Reserve\u00ae\nRoastery & Tasting Room\n\n<h2>1124 Pike Street Seattle, WA 98101</h2>\n\n(206) 624-0173\n\nJust nine blocks from our\noriginal Pike Place Market store.\n\n* Daily: 6:30AM - 11PM\n\n*\nFind out about space\navailable for rental\n\n\u00a9 OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nContact Customer Service\n\nContact Customer Service\n\nFollow us\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n* #StarbucksReserve\n\n* Starbucks.com\n\n* Privacy Policy\n\n\u00a92015 Starbucks Corporation.
