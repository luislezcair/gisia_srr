How the fresh leaves of the tea plant are processed and their level of contact with oxygen determine resulting types of tea. During oxidation, tea leaves undergo natural chemical reactions that result in distinctive color and taste characteristics. Green tea is not oxidized at all\u2014the leaves are steamed, rolled and dried while black tea is allowed to oxidize for two to four hours. Oolong tea falls somewhere between green and black teas, in that the leaves are only partially oxidized.\n\nTea is grown in thousands of tea gardens or estates around the world, resulting in thousands of flavorful variations. Like wines, each tea takes its name from the district in which it's grown, and each district is known for producing tea with unique flavor and character. Tea is also divided by grades, determined by leaf size. Smaller sized leaves are used in tea bags while the larger sized leaves can be found in packaged loose tea.\n\nHerbal teas do not come from Camellia sinensis, but are an infusion of leaves, roots, bark, seeds or flowers of other plants. They lack many of the unique characteristics of tea and are not linked with the research on the potential health benefits of traditional teas.\n\nState of the Industry\nTea Fact Sheet\nBrewing Tea\nFood Service Brochure\nGlossary of Terms\nWhat the Tea Leaves Say\nBunn Tea Basics Brochure\nTea to Your Health Brochure\n\n<h1>\n\nBecoming a Member\n\nSignup for Courses\n\nTea Talk\n\n* Brewing Tea\n* State of the Industry\n* Tea Fact Sheet\n* Tea & Health\n* Glossary of Terms\n* Daily Beverage Guidelines\n* Drink to your Health\n* References\n\n</h1>\n\nFeature Story\n\nContact Us\n\n362 5th Ave- Suite 801\nNew York , NY 10001\nTel: 212-986-9415\nFax: 212-697-8658\n\nSocial Media\n\n@pfg\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to receive news & updates.\n\n\u00a9 2016 TeaUSA .
