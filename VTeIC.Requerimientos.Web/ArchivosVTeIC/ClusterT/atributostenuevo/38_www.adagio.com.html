This summer harvest tea comes to us from one of our favorites, Puttabong Estate. These tea gardens are some of the highest in the world, at 6000 feet above sea level. At these high altitudes, the tea leaves grow more slowly, and have more time to develop their unique Darjeeling flavor. This one has sweet, white grape or dessert wine fragrance, slightly earthy, and smooth, sweet-tangy flavor with a more gentle astringency than typical for these teas.\n\nSteep at 212\u00b0 for 3-5 minutes.\n\n492 reviews\n\n5 recent reviews\n\n94\n\nsort: datevotes\n\nteabags\n\nOur teabags contain the same high-quality tea as our loose-tea offerings. Their pyramid shape gives the leaves plenty of room to unfurl and infuse, placing more flavor in each cup. Enjoy the superior flavor of gourmet tea with the convenience of a disposable bag.\n\nteabags\n\n15 full leaf pyramids\n\n$12\n\nfresh from origin\n\nDarjeeling is a town situated along the slopes of the beautiful, towering Himalayas. The town, and the tea plantations that stretch around it, are often enveloped in mist. This unique climate, along with the region's loamy soil, help produce one of the most unique and distinctive teas in the world. These altitudes place significant strain on the bushes, so they grow more slowly and have more time to develop flavor. The leaves are also more fragile, so they oxidize and dry up at different rates during production. That's why Darjeeling tea always 'looks like Fall' - brown, gold, green. No one else in the world has tea that tastes quite like authentic Darjeeling.\n\nThis tea contains a high level of caffeine\n\ndirect trade advantage\n\nWe import our teas direct from the artisan farmers whose names and faces you'll find throughout our catalog.\nThis makes our teas fresher than those offered by the companies who use middlemen and brokers, and also less expensive.\nHere's a comparison of how much more you'd be paying by buying this tea elsewhere:\n\nTeavana: 135% more expensive\n\nyou'll also enjoy\n\n94\n\nformosa bai hao\n\nscore: 94\n\nper cup: 45\u00a2\n\n94\n\nti kuan yin\n\nscore: 94\n\nper cup: 32\u00a2\n\nconnect with us\n\nFollow @AdagioTeas\n\nAdagio Teas\n\ninstant coupon\n\n$5off\n\nclaim now >>\n\napplies to any product, but not shipping\n\njoin our mailing list\n\nJoin our mailing list and we will keep you\nup-to-date on things happening at Adagio Teas.\n\nFirst Name:\nLast Name:\nEmail:\n\nsubscribe >>"
