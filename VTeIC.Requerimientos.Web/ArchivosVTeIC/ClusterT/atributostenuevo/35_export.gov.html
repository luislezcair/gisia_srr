Please note that, pursuant to the Safe Harbor Frequently Asked Question on Self-Certification, the commitment to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles is not time-limited, and a participating organization must continue to apply the Principles to data received under the Safe Harbor.\n\nOn July 12, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker joined European Union Commissioner V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 to announce the approval of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which will replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor. Secretary Pritzker announced that the Department will start accepting certifications on August 1st.\n\nAs of August 1, the Department of Commerce will stop accepting new submissions for self-certification to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. As of October 31, the Department will stop accepting U.S.-EU Safe Harbor re-certifications. The Department will maintain the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor List of participants.\n\nPlease note that this advisory does not apply to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which the Department will continue to administer.\n\nFor more information on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov .\n\n<h2>Introduction:</h2>\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s Directive on Data Protection went into effect in October of 1998, and would prohibit the transfer of personal data to non-European Union countries that do not meet the European Union (EU) \u201cadequacy\u201d standard for privacy protection. While the United States and the EU share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by the EU.\n\nIn order to bridge these differences in approach and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with the Directive, the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission developed a \"Safe Harbor\" framework and this website to provide the information an organization would need to evaluate \u2013 and then join \u2013 the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland developed a separate \"Safe Harbor\" framework to bridge the differences between the two countries\u2019 approaches to privacy and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with Swiss data protection law. This website also provides the information an organization would need to evaluate \u2013 and then join \u2013 the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor program.\n\nTo get started, please use the following links:\n\nU.S.\u2013European Union Safe Harbor Framework\n\nU.S.-Switzerland Safe Harbor Framework\n\n<h2>Eligibility for Self-Certification</h2>\n\nOnly U.S. organizations subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or U.S. air carriers and ticket agents subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DOT) may participate in the Safe Harbor. Organizations generally not subject to FTC jurisdiction include certain financial institutions, (such as banks, investment houses, credit unions, and savings & loan institutions), telecommunication common carriers, labor associations, non-profit organizations, agricultural co-operatives, and meat processing facilities. In addition, the FTC\u2019s jurisdiction with regard to insurance activities is limited to certain circumstances. If you are uncertain as to whether your organization falls under the jurisdiction of either the FTC or DOT, as certain exceptions to general ineligibility do exist, be sure to contact those agencies for more information.\n\n* Print  |\nLast Updated: 7/26/16 12:31 PM\n\nHow To Export\n\n* eCommerce\n* Export Education\n* Finding Foreign Markets\n* Legal Considerations\n* Logistics\n* Financial Considerations\n* Product Preparation\n\nCustomized Services\n\n* Services for U.S. Exporters\n* Plan and Assess\n* Promote and Expand\n* Locations\n\nMarket Intelligence\n\n* Find Market Intelligence\n* Export Guides\n* Trade Leads\n* Trade Data & Analysis\n* Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)\n\nEvents\n\n* Events and Trade Missions\n* Webinars\n\nTrade Problems\n\n* Get Help with Trade Problems\n* Report a Foreign Trade Barrier\n* Foreign Trade Remedies\n* Foreign Safeguard Activity Involving U.S. Exports\n* U.S. Products Subject to AD/CVD Measures\n\nFAQs\n\nBoards\n\nAbout Us\n\n* International Trade Administration\n* Federal Trade Partners\n* Programs for Trade Promotion Partners\n* Trade Initiatives\n* Contact Us\n* Social Media\n\n* Submit Feedback |\nContact Us\n|Social Media |Privacy Policy|FOIA |\nDisclaimer |\nAbout Us |\nUSA.gov |\nSite Map |\nDownload Adobe PDF Reader\n\nNotice to Visitors!\n\nThe link you have chosen will take you to a non-U.S. Government website.\n\nIf the page does not appear in 5 seconds, please click this: outside web site\n\nExport.gov is managed by the International Trade Administration and\nexternal links are covered by its website disclaimer statement.\n\nNotice to Visitors!\n\nThe link you have chosen will take you to a non-U.S. Government website.\n\nIf the page does not appear in 5 seconds, please click this: outside web site\n\nBuyUSA.gov is managed by the International Trade Administration and\nexternal links are covered by its website disclaimer statement."
