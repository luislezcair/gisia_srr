But, as with any good service, good products need to be delivered on time. This is particularly so for our users, as innovators and investors look for certainty at an early stage in the process. Patent strategies can depend upon accurate predictions as to the strength of their applications, and what objections they might need to overcome. Timeliness is therefore a key issue not just for applicants, but also those potentially affected by pending patent rights. Our users have stressed that it is a priority for them and, as such, timeliness is a priority for the EPO.\n\nSince July 2014, the EPO has addressed this issue effectively through the implementation of \u201cEarly Certainty from Search\u201d (ECfS), which aims to provide a high quality search report with a preliminary opinion on patentability within six months of filing. Just two years on, and accompanied by a dramatic reduction of backlogs, that six month objective has been achieved and the initiative fully implemented. It is a milestone in providing applicants with greater certainty in their patent applications and the user community has openly expressed its satisfaction.\n\nWe now have an opportunity to build upon that success and make further gains in timeliness, by streamlining other stages of the patent application process. Starting this year, the EPO is undertaking one of the most significant improvements to its services in recent times by extending Early Certainty to examination and opposition.\n\nFor examination, grants will be concluded on average within 12 months after the start of the examination procedure. To supplement the internal changes that are being orchestrated to achieve this, it has been decided to increase the existing 75% refund of the examination fee to 100% when the application is withdrawn before start of substantive examination. In addition, an additional 50% refund will be introduced in cases where the application is withdrawn after the first official communication.\n\nFor Opposition, we have now committed to ensuring that the overall duration of the procedure is reduced, from the current 26 months for cases with no specific legal complications, down to just 15 months. Much progress has already been made with the backlog of opposition files awaiting first action having fallen by nearly 75% over the last year. To steer us further towards attaining this 15 month target, the workflow of the opposition procedure has already been revised within the current legal framework as of 1 July this year. The streamlined opposition procedure simplifies opposition proceedings and is now set to deliver decisions faster, while giving parties more time to react to summons and prepare for oral proceedings.\n\nOver the coming years, the Office will simplify its procedures further with the aim of reducing pendency, optimising the use of examiner capacity and delivering gains in quality and timeliness. Efficiency improvements already made have ensured that we have the right tools and competences to gain full control over the timeliness of all our procedures by 2020; six months for a search and its opinion, 12 months on average for examination and 15 months for a standard opposition. We have listened to our users who have stressed the importance of timeliness and, with the Early Certainty initiative, we are set to deliver further progress in this area and successfully meet the requirements of the Paris Criteria.\n\nBeno\u00eet Battistelli\nPresident\n\n* <strong>Share this post:</strong>\n* Tweet\n*\n*\n\n<h2>Older posts</h2>\n\n<h2>The future of the Unitary Patent package</h2>\n\n11.7.2016\n\nLast week I spoke at a major conference hosted by the EPO in our Munich headquarters, convened to discuss the state of implementation of the Unitary Patent and the Unified Patent Court. Bringing together more than 200 participants from all over Europe, among them representatives of government authorities, business and academia as well as lawyers [\u2026]\n\n<h2>EPO Boards of Appeal: a landmark reform</h2>\n\n05.7.2016\n\nAt the meeting of the Administrative Council last week, the EPO\u2019s Member States adopted a proposal from the Office for reform of the Boards of Appeal, one of the most significant decisions in the history of our Organisation. Indeed, reform of the Boards of Appeal has been a topic on the table for some time [\u2026]\n\n<h2>Ten Years of Annual Bilateral Cooperation Meetings</h2>\n\n23.6.2016\n\n2016 is an important year for bilateral cooperation; it is the tenth year in which we have held an annual bilateral cooperation meeting, since the first of its kind was held in 2007 in Vilnius, Lithuania. I was therefore delighted last week to be in Tirana, Albania, for our annual meeting with the EPO\u2019s member [\u2026]\n\n<h2>EIA 2016: A symbol of vibrant innovation</h2>\n\n15.6.2016\n\nLast week in Portugal, the EPO held the 11th edition of its European Inventor Award in front of a packed audience and media from across the world at the MEO arena in Lisbon. In the presence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa and Commissioner Carlos Moedas, the winners in each of the categories were finally revealed. [\u2026]\n\n<h2>Reinforcing Gains in Quality</h2>\n\n02.6.2016\n\nIn every annual survey published by Intellectual Asset Management (IAM) magazine since 2010, the EPO has ranked first among the world\u2019s IP5 offices for the quality of both its patents and services. I am delighted to report that this year\u2019s survey, announced recently, has reconfirmed our position as a global leader in quality and marks [\u2026]\n\n<h2>The Benefits of Validation</h2>\n\n20.5.2016\n\nLast week I was delighted to represent the EPO at the first Casablanca IP week, organised under the High Patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI by the Ministry of Industry, Trade, Investment and the Digital Economy and the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property (OMPIC). The event included various conferences, round tables and [\u2026]\n\n<h2>PATLIB 2016</h2>\n\n04.5.2016\n\nWe forget sometimes that the world of patents can appear complex and daunting to those who do not have the time or resources to dedicate to patent searching or to analysing patent information. Happily, here in Europe, innovators can prosper from a network of professional centres that help them to maximise the impact of their [\u2026]\n\n<h2>Assessing Harmonisation on World Intellectual Property Day</h2>\n\n27.4.2016\n\nAlmost 15 years ago to the day, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) launched an event with the aim of increasing understanding of IP and its role. Celebrated every 26 April, it is an important vehicle for raising awareness of patents, copyright, trademarks and industrial designs. This year, the EPO had the pleasure of participating [\u2026]\n\n<h2>Enhancing Professional Training</h2>\n\n22.4.2016\n\nThis week I had the pleasure to welcome at the EPO a delegation from the institute of professional representatives (epi) in order to discuss recent progress and results, and also to sign a Memorandum of Understanding. Our meeting on Tuesday was the latest in our \u2018Partnership for Quality\u2019 dialogue, a process of continuous exchange with our [\u2026]\n\n\u2190 Older posts"
