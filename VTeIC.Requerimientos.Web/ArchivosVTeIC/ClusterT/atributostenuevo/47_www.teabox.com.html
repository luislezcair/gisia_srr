Great care goes into picking and processing tea. But factors such as climate, rainfall, soil, even the time of harvest makes a huge impact on a tea\u2019s flavor.\n\n\u201cFlushes\u201d refer to the different harvest periods for teas in India, and this term is more commonly associated with Darjeeling teas.\n\nIn Darjeeling, there are three main flushes which are observed in a year. The spring flush or the first flush of the years starts around mid-February after the first light showers of the year. This class of tea has an immensely fragrant and citrusy flavor profile, which results from the slow growth of the plants during the winter season. Because the flavors are ripe and concentrated in spring shoots, they are subjected to very little processing. As a result, most spring flush or first flush Darjeeling teas appear greenish in color.\n\nDarjeeling spring black tea\n\nThe summer flush or the second flush of the year occurs around April and lasts all the way til July. Second flush teas are harvested during peak summer between the months of June and July. During this period, due to ample sun and humid air, the plants tend to grow rapidly. As a result, the tea leaves tend to be more mature-looking and boast a much smoother flavor profile than the first flush teas. Teas from this flush are well-known for producing a full-bodied liquor that\u2019s tipped with dense fruity flavors, often resembling grape, cooked peaches, and cantaloupe. This is also the flush during with Darjeeling muscatels get made, regarded by many as an exemplary class of summer teas. The second flush teas of Assam offer a tough competition to the Darjeelings, thanks to their robust liquor and rich flavors of malt, honey, and wood.\n\nDarjeeling summer flush black tea from the Giddapahar tea estate\n\nProduced right after the monsoon passes over, autumn flush or the third flush produces one of the most aromatic varieties of teas that are renowned (in their niche) for their mellow floral-fruity characteristics.Autumn teas are typically harvested before \u2018Durga Pooja\u2019 or mid-October and continues till a few weeks after \u2018Diwali\u2019, and that\u2019s usually around mid-November. Autumnals are also held as self-drinking teas since most can be consumed plain without the addition of condiments.\n\nDarjeeling autumn black tea from the Poobong estate\n\nWinter flush teas or frost teas are rare and only produced in the Nilgiris \u2013 a tea growing region in the south of India. The teas here tend to grow all year round because the region enjoys a unique climate that\u2019s a mix of both tropical and sub-tropical conditions. It does not snow here but frost tends to envelop much of the region during peak winters. As a result, the tea plants grown slowly throughout the three months of winter. These teas have an immensely aromatic flavor profile and a dark appearance and produce a smooth liquor that\u2019s ample in the mouth, filling, and complex, too.\n\nWinter flush black tea the Glendale estate in the Nilgiris\n\n0\n\nTea Flushes .\n\nOlder \u00bb\n\nTEAS\n\n*\n<strong>By Type</strong>\n\n* Black Tea\n* Green Tea\n* Oolong Tea\n* White Tea\n* Chai Tea\n\n*\n<strong>By Region</strong>\n\n* Darjeeling\n* Assam\n* Nilgiri\n* Kangra\n* North East\n\n* <strong>By Speciality</strong>\n* New\n* Best Selling\n* Sale\n* Blends\n* Samples\n\nABOUT US\n\n* About Teabox\n* Guaranteed Freshness\n* Testimonials\n* Blog\n* Wholesale\n* Brewing\n* The crew\n* Careers\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICES\n\n* Shipping & Delivery\n* Help Desk\n* Contact Us\n* Track Order\n\nPOLICIES\n\n* Terms of use\n* Security\n* Privacy Policy\n\nSOCIAL CONNECT\n\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\n*\n*\n\n* Copyright \u00a9 2016 Tea Stories | Best Tea Blog | Still Steeping \u2013 The Teabox Blog."
