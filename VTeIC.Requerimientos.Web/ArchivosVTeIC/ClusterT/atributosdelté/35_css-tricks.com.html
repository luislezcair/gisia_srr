The most basic selection is by tag name, like\np { }\n\n. Almost anything more specific than a tag selector uses attributes \u2014\nclass\n\nand\nID\n\nboth select on those attributes on HTML elements. But\nclass\n\nand\nID\n\naren't the only attributes developers can select. We can use any of an element's attributes as selectors.\n\nAttribute selection has a special syntax. Here's an example:\n\na[href=\"https://css-tricks.com\"] {\n\ncolor: #E18728;\n\n}\n\nThat's an <strong>exact match</strong> selector that will only select links with the exact\nhref\n\nattribute value of \"https://css-tricks.com\".\n\nThe Seven Different Types\n\nAttribute selectors are case-sensitive, and are written inside brackets\n[]\n\n.\n\nThere are seven different types of matches you can find with an attribute selector, and the syntax is different for each. Each of the more complex attribute selectors build on the syntax of the exact match selector \u2014 they all start with the attribute name and end with an equals sign followed by the attribute value(s), usually in quotes. What goes between the attribute name and equals sign is what makes the difference among the selectors.\n\n[data-value] {\n\n/* Attribute exists */\n\n}\n\n[data-value=\"foo\"] {\n\n/* Attribute has this exact value */\n\n}\n\n[data-value*=\"foo\"] {\n\n/* Attribute value contains this value somewhere in it */\n\n}\n\n[data-value~=\"foo\"] {\n\n/* Attribute has this value in a space-separated list somewhere */\n\n}\n\n[data-value^=\"foo\"] {\n\n/* Attribute value starts with this */\n\n}\n\n[data-value=|\"foo\"] {\n\n/* Attribute value has this in a dash-separated list somewhere */\n\n}\n\n[data-value$=\"foo\"] {\n\n/* Attribute value ends with this */\n\n}\n\n<strong>Value contains:</strong> attribute value contains a term as the only value, a value in a list of values, or as part of another value. To use this selector, add an asterisk (*) before the equals sign. For example,\nimg[alt*=\"art\"]\n\nwill select images with the alt text \"abstract art\" and \"athlete starting a new sport\", because the value \"art\" is in the word \"starting\".\n\n<strong>Value is in a space-separated list:</strong> value is either the only attribute value, or is a whole value in a space-separated set of values. Unlike the \"contains\" selector, this selector will not look for the value as a word fragment. To use this selector, add a tilde (~) before the equals sign. For example,\nimg[alt~=\"art\"]\n\nwill select images with the alt text \"abstract art\" and \"art show\", but not \"athlete starting a new sport\" (which the \"contains\" selector would select).\n\n<strong>Value starts with:</strong> attribute value starts with the selected term. To use this selector, add a caret (^) before the equals sign. Don't forget, case-sensitivity matters. For example, img[alt^=\"art\"] will select images with the alt text \"art show\" and \"artistic pattern\", but not an image with the alt text \"Arthur Miller\" because \"Arthur\" begins with a capital letter.\n\n<strong>Value is first in a dash-separated list:</strong> This selector is very similar to the \"starts with\" selector. Here, the selector matches a value that is either the only value or is the first in a dash-separated list of values. To use this selector, add a pipe character (|) before the equals sign. For example,\nli[data-years|=\"1900\"]\n\nwill select list items with a\ndata-years\n\nvalue of \"1900-2000\", but not the list item with a\ndata-years\n\nvalue of \"1800-1900\".\n\n<strong>Value ends with:</strong> attribute value ends with the selected term. To use this selector, add a dollar sign ($) before the equals sign. For example,\na[href$=\"pdf\"]\n\nselects every link that ends with .pdf.\n\n<strong>A note about quotes:</strong> You can go without quotes around the value in some circumstances, but the rules for selecting without quotes are inconsistent cross-browser. Quotes always work, so if you stick to using them you can be sure your selector will work.\n\nSee the Pen Attribute Selectors by CSS-Tricks (@css-tricks) on CodePen.\n\nFun fact: the values are treated as strings, so you don't have to do any fancy escaping of characters to make them match, as you would if you used unusual characters in a class or ID selector.\n\n[class=\"(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b\"]{\n\ncolor: red;\n\nfont-weight: bold;\n\n}\n\nCombining them\n\nYou can combine an attribute selector with other selectors, like tag, class, or ID.\n\ndiv[attribute=\"value\"] {\n\n/* style rules here */\n\n}\n\n.module[attribute=\"value\"] {\n\n/* style rules here */\n\n}\n\n#header[attribute=\"value\"] {\n\n/* style rules here */\n\n}\n\nOr even combine multiple attribute selectors. This example selects images with alt text that includes the word \"person\" as the only value or a value in a space separated list, and a\nsrc\n\nvalue that includes the value \"lorem\":\n\nimg[alt~=\"person\"][src*=\"lorem\"] {\n\n/* style rules here */\n\n}\n\nSee the Pen Combined Attributes and Attribute-Only Selection by CSS-Tricks (@css-tricks) on CodePen.\n\nAttribute Selectors in JavaScript and jQuery\n\nAttribute selectors can be used in jQuery just like any other CSS selector. In JavaScript, you can use attribute selectors with\ndocument.querySelector()\n\nand\ndocument.querySelectorAll()\n\n.\n\nSee the Pen Attribute Selectors in JS and jQuery by CSS-Tricks (@css-tricks) on CodePen.\n\nRelated\n\n* class\n* ID\n\nMore Information\n\n* The Skinny on Attribute Selectors\n* Attribute selectors at MDN\n* Attribute selectors in the W3C CSS spec\n\nBrowser Support\n\nChrome\nSafari\nFirefox\nOpera\nIE\nAndroid\niOS\n\nAny Any Any Any 7+ Any Any\n\n<h1> Comments\n</h1>\n\n*\n\nDruid of L\u00fbhn\n\nPermalink to comment# February 27, 2012\n\nAbout using [rel$=external]\nYou could use it with an :after selector on links ending in \u201c.pdf\u201d to have an icon at the end.\n\nReply \u2193\n\n*\n\nshahryar\n\nPermalink to comment# July 22, 2012\n\nDo Multiple attribute work in all browser?\nthanks\n\nReply \u2193\n\n*\n\nGumnos\n\nPermalink to comment# March 8, 2015\n\nWhile I like the power of these, I\u2019m regularly frustrated that they don\u2019t seem to be dynamic:\n\n<style>\ninput[checked]:after {\ncontent: attr(name);\nbackground-color: green;\nposition: absolute;\nright:0;\n}</style><form>\n<ul>\n<li><input type=checkbox name='unchkd'>unchecked</input>\n<li><input type=checkbox name='chkd' checked>checked</input>\n</ul></form>\n\nwhich I keep hoping would update the CSS based on the \u201cchecked\u201d property toggling on/off.

It seems not to work on element selectors (I\u2019ve tried it on ).\nYou could add a class to your element and use the attribute selector on the class.
