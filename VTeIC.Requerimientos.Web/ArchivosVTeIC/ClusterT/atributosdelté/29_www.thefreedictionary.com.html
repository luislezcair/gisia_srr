to show how easy it is for generous sentiments, high courtesy, and chivalrous courage to lose their influence beneath the chilling blight of selfishness, and to exhibit to the world a man who was great in all the minor attributes of character, but who was found wanting when it became necessary to prove how much principle is superior to policy.\nView in context\n\nAll merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent; nor does nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty, that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay, as she sows wall-flowers over the ruined fortress of Ticonderoga.\nView in context\n\nI smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress.\nView in context\n\nNo, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him.\nView in context\n\nBut, though she had taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any attributes save those she possessed.\nView in context\n\nThere is hardly a servant-maid in these days who is not better informed than Miss Nancy; yet she had the essential attributes of a lady--high veracity, delicate honour in her dealings, deference to others, and refined personal habits,--and lest these should not suffice to convince grammatical fair ones that her feelings can at all resemble theirs, I will add that she was slightly proud and exacting, and as constant in her affection towards a baseless opinion as towards an erring lover.\nView in context\n\nOther generalisations proving equally unprofitable, I began scientifically to consider in detail the attributes of the supposititious paragon,--attributes of body and mind and heart.\nView in context\n\nTo teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie, if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.\nView in context\n\nThese, as well as all the more minute points of light and shadow, are attributes proper to scenery in general, natural to each situation, and subject to the artist's disposal, as his taste or pleasure may dictate.\nView in context\n\nIf we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to him?\nView in context\n\nIt would not perhaps be rash to predict, that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh all the peculiar attributes of the Senate.\nView in context\n\n<strong>Dictionary browser</strong>?\n\n* \u25b2\n* attractancy\n* attractant\n* attracted\n* attracter\n* Attractile\n* attracting\n* attractingly\n* attraction\n* attraction sphere\n* attractive\n* attractive feature\n* attractive force\n* attractive nuisance\n* attractively\n* attractiveness\n* attractivity\n* attractor\n* attrahens\n* attrahent\n* attrap\n* Attrectation\n* attrib\n* attrib.\n* attributable\n* attribute\n* attributes\n* attribution\n* attribution theory\n* attributional\n* attributive\n* attributive genitive\n* attributive genitive case\n* attributively\n* attrist\n* attrit\n* attrite\n* attrited\n* attrition\n* attrition minefield\n* attrition rate\n* attrition reserve aircraft\n* attrition sweeping\n* attritional\n* Attritus\n* Attroopment\n* Attry\n* Attu\n* Attu Island\n* Attucks\n* Attucks Crispus\n* attuent\n* \u25bc\n\n<strong>Full browser</strong>?\n\n* \u25b2\n* attribute vicariously\n* Attribute-Based Access Matrix\n* Attribute-Based Architectural Style\n* Attribute-Logic Engine\n* Attribute-Relation File Format\n* attribute-specific rate\n* attribute-specific rate\n* attribute-specific rate\n* attribute-specific rate\n* attribute-specific rate\n* attribute-specific rate\n* Attribute-Value\n* Attribute-value pair\n* attributed\n* attributed\n* attributed\n* attributed\n* attributed\n* attributed\n* Attributed File System\n* Attributed File System\n* Attributed Relational Graph\n* Attributed Tip Income Program\n* Attributed Tip Income Program\n* attributed to\n* attributer\n* attributer\n* attributer\n* attributer\n* attributer\n* attributes\n* Attributes for Representing Relationships\n* Attributes of god\n* Attributes of god\n* Attributes of god\n* Attributes of god\n* attributes testing\n* attributing\n* attributing\n* attributing\n* attributing\n* attributing\n* attribution\n* attribution\n* attribution\n* attribution\n* attribution\n* Attribution Rule\n* Attribution Rules\n* Attribution theory\n* Attribution theory\n* Attribution theory\n* Attribution theory\n* Attribution theory\n* attributional\n* attributional\n* attributional\n* attributional\n* attributional\n* Attributional Style Questionnaire Failure Composite\n* attributions\n* \u25bc\n\n* Facebook Share\n* Twitter\n* Google+\n\nCITE\n\n<strong>Site:</strong>Follow:\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\n* Google+\n* Rss\n* Mail\n\nShare:\n* Facebook\n* Twitter\n* LinkedIn\n* Mail\n\nOpen / Close\n\n<strong>More from </strong><strong>Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Translations</strong>\n\n<strong>Mobile Apps</strong>\n* Apple\n* Android\n* Kindle\n* Windows\n* Windows Phone\n\n<strong>Free Tools</strong>\n\n<strong>For surfers:</strong>\n* Free toolbar & extensions\n* Word of the Day\n* Help\n\n<strong>For webmasters:</strong>\n* Free content\n* Linking\n* Lookup box\n\n* Terms of Use\n* Privacy policy\n* Feedback\n* Advertise with Us\n\n<strong>Copyright \u00a9 2003-2016 Farlex, Inc</strong>\n\n<strong>Disclaimer</strong>\nAll content on this website, including dictionary, thesaurus, literature, geography, and other reference data is for informational purposes only.
